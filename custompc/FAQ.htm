	<div>We want to make sure that you have the components that will best fit your needs. 
	If you are unsure what components you need please refer to the guide below. 
	Note:  All components are tested to ensure they are in proper working condition prior to shipment.
	All components come with at least a 2 year manufacturers warranty, some warranties are much longer.  
	Please be aware that Custom PC is not resonsible for any hardware failures that may occur after a PC has been delivered.
	If there is such an occurance, it is the customers resonsibility to contact the manufacturer for replacement parts covered under warranty.

<div id="FAQcomponent1"><p class="FAQheading" onclick="menu1()">Computer Case &#8675</p></div>
	<div id="FAQDropdown1" class="drop-content">We will ensure that all components you choose will fit in the case prior to offering a quote.
	Things to consider when choosing a case:<br><br>
	-A larger case will have room for future hardware upgrades.<br><br>
	-A smaller case can fit in specific locations (go to manufacturers website for dimensions of specific cases).<br><br>
	-Aesthetics: Getting a custom PC means you can have a better/different looking computer than everyone else.<br>
	</div>
<div id="FAQcomponent2"><p class="FAQheading" onclick="menu2()">Processor &#8675</p></div>
	<div id="FAQDropdown2" class="drop-content">Choosing the right processor will depend on each individuals usage. 
	For Example: If your only activity is web browsing, then there will be no noticeable difference between a low end or high end processor.<br><br>
	Consider these activities when choosing a lower end processor (A series, i3):<br><br>
	-Web browsing, basic office use, emails, burning/listening to music, simple games (solitaire, minesweeper), not many programs opened at once, etc.<br><br>
	Consider these activities when choosing a high end processor (FX8350, i5, i7):<br><br>
	-Gaming, frequent video editing, heavy office use (lots of programs open at once), 3D simulation/modeling, CFD or FEA analysis, etc.<br><br>
	</div>
<div id="FAQcomponent3"><p class="FAQheading" onclick="menu3()">Memory(RAM) &#8675</p></div>
	<div id="FAQDropdown3" class="drop-content">Choosing the right amount of RAM will also depend on each individuals usage. Consider the following:<br><br>
	-For basic tasks the difference between 4GB and 8GB will not be noticeable because the system will not utilize the extra memory.<br><br>
	-We recommend 8GB for most users, the cost difference between 4GB and 8GB is currently small enough that, unless on a very strict budget, will be worth it even if utilized rarely.<br><br> 
	-Some AAA games will utilize more than 8GB memory, as well as other intensive tasks (same tasks listed for high end cpu).  For these we recommend 16GB.<br><br>
	-Most users will not need 32GB of RAM unless they are using virtual machines or for very intensive tasks.<br>
	</div>
<div id="FAQcomponent4"><p class="FAQheading" onclick="menu4()">Graphics Card &#8675</p></div>
	<div id="FAQDropdown4" class="drop-content">If you do not plan on using your PC for Gaming, frequent video editing, or simulation then we recommend choosing INTEGRATED GRAPHICS.<br><br>
	For gaming please visit <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/bench/GPU16/1489" target="_blank">Anandtech.com</a> for benchmarks on the latest games. Then choose the card that will suit your needs. <br><br>
	For other tasks that require graphics cards please ensure that it can do what you want it to.<br>
	</div>
<div id="FAQcomponent5"><p class="FAQheading" onclick="menu5()">Hard Drives &#8675</p></div>
	<div id="FAQDropdown5" class="drop-content">First consideration for a Hard Drive is: Capacity.  If you are planning on storing all pictures & videos that you are going to take for the next 5 years on it, choose a high enough capacity that you aren't going to run out of space.<br><br>
	Second consideration: Custom PC HIGHLY recommends getting an SSD, even if it is only a 120GB for your OS and a few other programs.  For most users that aren't gaming, an SSD will provide the most noticeable performance increase of any other PC component you can get!<br>
