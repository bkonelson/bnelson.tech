	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	My brother-in-law was in need of a computer and I interviewed him to see what exactly he wanted.
	He works for a construction company which he is going to own in the future, and he also does some
	gaming. He needs something that he can use for the business as well as for entertainment. His wife 
	uses the internet for pintrest, facebook, etc. and also is trying to start a small business for
	home decoration/crafts.  The three different systems that I found for him, and their specs, can be found below.

	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	<p>
	I decided they should go with the Basic Custom PC as it will fit their needs best and their budget.
	Some of the top considerations were:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>price to performance ratio</li>
		<li>hard disk space and speed</li>
		<li>graphics capability</li>
		<li>use for business</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	This PC has a lot of hard disk space for their businesses and is also good for gaming. 
	I decided to go with Windows for the operating system because although it is more expensive, it provides 
	better drivers for video hardware and they are already familiar with how it works.  They didn't have much 
	of a need for portability, as they already have portable devices. With that in mind, the monitor being 
	larger and graphics for the desktops ruled out the laptop.  The high end PC would have met their needs 
	plus some, but doesn't provide the level of added benefit that the price might suggest.
