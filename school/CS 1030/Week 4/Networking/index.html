	<h1>Project Scope</h1>
	<p>
		This is a parts list and description of hardware for a 45-employee business.  The cost
		of the components and the reasoning behind choosing each one can be found below.

	<h1>Switch</h1>
	<img src="images/switch.jpg" alt="Switch Picture">
	<p>
		This 48-port switch will be able to handle the traffic from all 45 employees, plus a
		connection to the router and 2 for servers/databases.  It is always good to plan
		for the future, so it might be a good idea to get 2 of these and daisy chain them.
		Two wouldn't be necessary initially though.
	</p>
	<h1>Cables</h1>
	<img src="images/cables.jpg" alt="Switch Picture">
	<p>
		I assumed that every employee would require 100 ft. of Cat5e cable, probably a little
		high but it's always good to have extra.  So with 45 employees that is 4500 ft. which
		is why I would opt to get 5000 ft. of cable.  I also discovered there are different qualifications
		for Cat(X) cable which I read about here (
		<a href="http://www.belden.com/blog/datacenters/Communications-Cable-Ratings.cfm" target="_blank">CMR vs CMP</a>).
		So with that in mind I would also need a bunch of conduit to put the cables in, but I haven't included
		those in this as I felt it was beyond the scope of this page.  There would be a lot of different conduit
		pieces though that would need to be purchased and it would change depending on the layout of the building.
	</p>
	<h1>Router</h1>
	<img src="images/router.jpg" alt="Switch Picture">
	<p>
		The router has gigabit ethernet ports which are more then enough for the 150 Mbps maximum
		bandwidth that will be coming from the ISP.  At some point the company may want to get some
		wireless access points but to start out I felt that this was good.
	</p>
	<h1>RJ-45 Connectors</h1>
	<img src="images/rj45.jpg" alt="Switch Picture">
	<p>
		Connectors to go with the Cat5e cable.  They would need a crimping tool to go along with these and
		a cable tester would be a good thing as well, but I just assumed that we the contractors would already 
		have those tools readily available.
	</p>
	<h1>Internet Package</h1>
	<p>
		With 45 employess and a bandwidth of 150 Mbps, which calculates to 3.33 Mbps to every employee if the 
		traffic is perfectly dispersed.  It will never be perfectly dispersed but that should be good enough for
		everyday office use. They won't all be able to stream Netfilx HD at the same time, but that's okay.
