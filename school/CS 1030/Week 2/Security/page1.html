	<h2>Some of the most common services that are placed in the DMZ are:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Web Servers</li>
		<li>Mail Servers</li>
		<li>FTP Servers</li>
		<li>VoIP Servers</li>
	</ol>
	<p>	
		Any service that is being provided to users on the external network can be placed here.
		Anything with sensitive or private information should be kept on the internal network.
		The servers on the DMZ can then communicate with the internal network either directly or through 
		an application firewall for any information that is needed.  This reduces access to 
		the internal network.
