	<h1>DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)</h1>
	<p> 
		A DMZ or demilitarized zone is a sub-network that contains external facing services
		that are exposed to a larger network such as the internet.  The purpose of a DMZ is to 
		add a layer of security to the internal network of an organization.  Outside or unknown traffic 
		can interact with the servers located in the DMZ, while the internal network is protected by additional firewalls.<br><br>
