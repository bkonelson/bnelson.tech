	<h2>Two of the most basic ways to design a network with DMZ are as follows:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Single Firewall</li>
		<li>Dual Firewall</li>
	</ul>

	<p>	
		In the single firewall network there are three legs: the internal network, the dmz, 
		and the external network.  In this network the firewall is a single point of failure.  
		It has to handle traffic going to both the DMZ and the internal network.  
	</p>

	<p>	
		In the dual firewall network there are two firewalls.  One that connects to both the DMZ 
		and internal network, and another one for just the internal network.  This is a more secure approach 
		then just using a single firewall, as all the communication that goes to the potentially
		sensitive information has to go through multiple firewalls.
