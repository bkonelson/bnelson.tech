<h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
	<h2 style="color:#D2691E;">Overview</h2>
		<p>Ada Lovelace was a mathematician best known for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.
		She is known as the first computer programmer, and the concept of the program loop is attributed to her.
		Her full name is Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace.  She was born in 1815 and often ill growing up. Her mother was bitter 
		over Ada's father Lord Byron leaving the family, and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic to prevent her from developing
		what she saw as insanity of her father. Her education put her in contact with people like, Andrew Crosse, Michael Faraday, Charles Dickens, and
		of course Charles Babbage.  She eventually died of uterine cancer at the age of 36.</p>
	<h2 style="color:#D2691E;">Contribution to Technology</h2>
		<p>Here are some of her contributions to computer science:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>She described an algorithm for the the analytical machine to compute Bernoulli numbers, which
			is considered the first published algorithm specifically tailored to be run on a computer.  This is 
			the reason she is referred to as the first programmer.</li>
			<li>Realized the capability of a computer to solve complex problems beyond just simple number crunching.</li>
			<li>Used her background of music to theorize how computers could be used for music, poetry, and beyond.</li>
		</ul>
	<h2 style="color:#D2691E;">Importance</h2>
		<p>The major contribution of Ada Lovelace was in the realization of what the computer could be, its potential.  Her mentor Charles Babbage 
		focused on the number computing functions, but Ada saw beyond that.  For her contributions the computer language "Ada", which was
		created on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1980s, was named after her.</p>
