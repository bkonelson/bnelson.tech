		<h2>Introduction</h2>

			There are a lot of different options out there for vehicles.  When it
			comes to vehicles with more than 4 seats however, the options are limited.

			for people with children, and why some people don't want to accept that.

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			Mini-vans sometimes have a bad connotation. They are often associated with boring
			housewives, and fathers who have traded in the majority of their manliness for
			a life of tantrums and poopy diapers. However; after looking at the fact sheets
			for all three vehicle types, it is easy to see that mini-vans are much more than a 
			signal to society that you've lost all of your sex appeal.  They are quality vehicles
			that really fit the needs of a large group of consumers, and they fit the need well.
