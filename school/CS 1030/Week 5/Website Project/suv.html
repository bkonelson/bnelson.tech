		<h2>Summary and Explanation</h2>
		<p>
			The average price of SUVs varies quite a bit but for large SUVs it is quite high.  Most
			of them start at around $35,000 without any options.  The gas mileage is similar to a truck,
			very much not what is wanted for the long road trips to Disneyland. To get into the back seats
			is quite a challenge, and for the parent of a 2-year old it would make life quite difficult.
			And although there are a couple SUVs with good reliability ratings, such as the Honda CR-V, large
			SUVs with 3 rows of seating don't make the cut.
