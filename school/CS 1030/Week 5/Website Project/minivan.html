		<h2>Summary and Explanation</h2>
		<p>
			The average price minivans is much better than SUVs or Trucks.  The ease of use
			can't be overstated, automatic sliding doors, DVD players, stow-and-go seating.  
			It's a dream come true for anybody with children.  The gas mileage is better than
			a Truck or SUV, almost like it's for family outings instead of hunting or off-road.
			The lifespan is very good for minivans, the Honda Odyssey in particular has received
			awards for this on several occasions.  In short, everything you need in a family vehicle.
