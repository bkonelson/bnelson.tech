		<h2>Summary and Explanation</h2>
		<p>
			The average price of trucks is quite high for a full-sized pick-up.  They have a lot more power
			than is really needed to take the kids to soccer practice.  They are very roomy inside, but lack
			a third row.  So if you have 3 kids you better make sure to be diligent with the contraceptives. 
			Otherwise plan to get a new vehicle.  The gas mileage is quite bad, but that shouldn't be unexpected.
			The lifespan of trucks is decent, but you pay for it up front.
